# Prework-study-guide

## Description

Prework Study Guide Webpage was created for bootcamp students going through the prework, it contains notes on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I was introduced to this course by a good friend of mine.
I built this project to get a basic understanding of the language and tools used to web develop.
It solved variable issues and taught me how to understand the basics.
I learnt basic developer terminology, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and how to use different functions needed for web developing.
